 * \brief The DedicatedFile class.
 *
 * A DedicatedFile object acts as a container for objects of any File subclass except the IsoFileSystem class itself.
 * It emulates the ISO "Dedicated File".
 * Children are stored as references. This means that if a File is being altered after it was added as child,
 * the child is effectively altered as well because it is the same object.
 *
 * The initial size of the array storing the references to the children can be set before compilation.
 * This class tries to increase the size until a maximum value. If you do not want that kind of behavior,
 * set CHILDREN_COUNT_MAX to the same value as CHILDREN_COUNT_START.
